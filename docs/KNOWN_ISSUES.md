## ✅ BUG-1 (FIXED) — undefined globals crashed the failed-login alert → Chrome closed

**File:** `ReplyBotv7/new.py` · **Status: fixed (2026-06-10).**

`send_or_update_failed_login_notice` (and the status/report senders, and `_load/_save_failed_login_state`)
referenced module globals that were **never assigned anywhere**:

| Symbol | Used at | Was defined? |
|--------|---------|--------------|
| `FAILED_LOGIN_LOCK` | `new.py:487`, `:701` (`with FAILED_LOGIN_LOCK:`) | ❌ → ✅ now defined |
| `FAILED_LOGIN_STATE_FILE` | `:336`, `:353` | ❌ → ✅ |
| `STATUS_STATE_FILE`, `REPORT_STATE_FILE`, `STATS_CHECKPOINT_FILE` | various | ❌ → ✅ |
| `LAST_FAILED_ALERT_EDIT_TS`, `LAST_STATUS_EDIT_TS`, `LAST_REPORT_EDIT_TS` | read before first assign | ❌ → ✅ |

**Effect (before the fix):** `send_or_update_failed_login_notice` ran `log_login_failure` (line ~501 —
which is why failed accounts *do* show `logged_out` in Supabase) and then hit `with FAILED_LOGIN_LOCK:`
→ `NameError`. The error propagated out of `run_account`'s `try` → `finally: driver.quit()` → **the Chrome
window closed.** A real log confirmed it: `Unexpected error for 3_cookies.json: NameError: name
FAILED_LOGIN_LOCK is not defined` followed by `Browser closed`. This was the *actual* reason "Chrome
closes when an account fails to log in," and it **defeated the persistent-login retry loop**.

**The fix:** all eight globals are now defined at module scope (a `threading.Lock()`, four `Path`
state-files under `ReplyBotv7/telemetry_state/`, and three `0.0` edit-timestamps) right after the other
module globals near the top of `new.py`. Verified: the module compiles and all eight names resolve as
module-level assignments. The failed-login alert path can now run to completion, so the persistent-login
loop stays alive and Chrome stays open across retries.

> Note: with the Telegram change below (BUG-1 is now moot for the *alert send* because ReplyBot delegates
> alerts to the broker), the `FAILED_LOGIN_LOCK` block is usually skipped anyway — but the globals are
> still needed for the status/report/clear paths and for robustness, so the definitions stay.

## 🟠 BUG-2 — reply/message counts silently stay 0

**File:** `ReplyBotv7/new.py`

`bot_statistics` is initialized as `{}` (`new.py:37`); the sub-dicts `option1_replies`, `option2_replies`,
`option11_messages`, `option12_messages` are **never created**. `update_statistics` does
`bot_statistics['option1_replies'][acct] = …` (`~:4053`) → `KeyError` on the first reply, swallowed by the
surrounding `try/except`. So per-account reply/message counts can stay **0** even when replies are sent
(matches `telemetry/ReplyBot_3.json` showing `replies:0`). `recover_and_report_previous_session` only
populates keys that already exist, so a cold start doesn't fix it.

**Fix:** initialize the sub-dicts (`bot_statistics.setdefault('option1_replies', {})`, etc.) at startup,
or use `defaultdict`.

---

## 🟠 BUG-3 — TOTP/credentials fallback broken by undefined `logger`

**File:** `ReplyBotv7/new.py:3406` `load_account_credentials`

References `logger` at `~:3435-3436` but `logger` is **not** a parameter → `NameError` whenever a valid
credentials file is found, defeating the credentials/TOTP login path (caught by callers, so it silently
falls back to cookie-only).

**Fix:** pass `logger` into `load_account_credentials` (or use a module logger) and remove the bare refs.

---

## 🟠 BUG-4 — `published_csv` cookie refresh always throws

**File:** `ReplyBotv7/new.py:~2548`

The `published_csv` branch of `refresh_account_cookies` references an undefined `fieldnames` (should be
`reader.fieldnames`) → that branch always raises. Only `api` mode works (the active config uses `api`).
Also: `run_account`'s pre-login cookie sync is gated on `gs_cfg.get('published_csv_url')` even though the
active mode is `api` — it only works because the config happens to include *both* keys; removing
`published_csv_url` would silently skip the first-login pre-sync.

---

## 🟡 BUG-5 — CommentsReplyBot: two reply-count sources disagree

**File:** `CommentsReplyBot/facebook_bot.py`

The Supabase reply counters are now session-accurate (logged once at the real send moment), but the
**local telemetry JSON** `stats.replied` and `show_stats()` are still derived from
`len(processed_comments)` (cumulative). So the web dashboard (Supabase) and the Telegram broker
(telemetry JSON) show different reply numbers. Also `final_status=='unconfirmed'` counts as success for
control flow but is **not** logged as `reply_sent`, so submitted-but-unverified replies don't appear in
dashboard counts. `self.session_replies/session_failures` are incremented but never read.

---

## 🟡 BUG-6 — AutoJoinBot: stubbed notifier + brittle regex + buggy local mode

**File:** `AutoJoinBot/join_groups.py`

- The Telegram notifier is intentionally stubbed (no routine messages) — fine, but `send_or_update`
  writes telemetry only if a regex matches the exact emoji format of `format_progress`; change that
  string and telemetry silently stops.
- `local_accounts` multi-account path (`:1334-1337`) passes the wrong thread args → `TypeError` if used
  (empty in shipped config).
- The single-account `do_join` path writes no state/telemetry/stats and doesn't skip processed groups.
- `accounts_numbers` heuristic: `[1,7]` is auto-expanded to the **range** 1-7, not two discrete indices.
- AutoJoin never calls `start_session`/`end_session` → Supabase session left `running`.

## ✅ Fixed — FewFeed extension (`fewfeedv2`) not loading in Chrome

**File:** `fewfeedbotv6/fewfeed_bot_template.py` · **Status: fixed (multi-layer).**

Chrome is placed into **"managed by your organisation"** mode by Windows Group Policy
machine files (`C:\WINDOWS\System32\GroupPolicy\Machine`) — **not** registry keys.
Because the policy source is a file (not `HKCU`/`HKLM` registry), clearing the registry
alone never fixed it. The `--load-extension` flag is silently ignored in this state.

**Fix — three-layer loading strategy:**

1. **Pre-launch (registry clearing + profile cleanup)** — `_clear_chrome_extension_policies()`
   still runs to handle machines where GPO comes from registry instead. Profile policy
   folders (`Default/Policy`, `Default/managed_storage`, `Default/Managed Users`) are
   deleted from the session copy. `Default/Preferences` is updated with
   `extensions.ui.developer_mode = true` so the "Load unpacked" button is pre-enabled.

2. **At launch** — `--enable-unsafe-extension-automation` + `--enable-extensions` +
   `--load-extension={ext_path}` are passed. Works on unmanaged machines. Silent
   no-op on managed machines (caught by the post-launch check).

3. **Post-launch fallback** (`_load_extension_post_launch`) — called if
   `_check_extension_loaded()` detects the extension did not load:
   - **Phase A (CDP):** `Extensions.loadUnpacked` via ChromeDriver CDP — instant,
     no UI. Works on Chrome 116+ with `--enable-unsafe-extension-automation`.
   - **Phase B (UI automation):** Opens `chrome://extensions` in a new tab,
     enables the developer mode toggle via shadow DOM
     (`extensions-manager → extensions-toolbar → #devMode`), clicks
     `#loadUnpacked`, pastes the extension path via clipboard (`win32clipboard`)
     into the filename field, presses Enter (which navigates INTO the folder),
     then clicks **"Select Folder"** via `win32gui.SendMessage(btn, BM_CLICK)`.
     This explicit button click is required — pressing Enter a second time does
     NOT confirm; it either navigates again or is ignored by the Win32 dialog.
     The dialog class is `#32770`, title `'Select the extension directory.'`.
     **Tested on Chrome 149 — confirmed working.**

`_check_extension_loaded()` inspects the `extensions-item-list` shadow DOM after
Chrome starts to decide which path was taken, so the logs will say either
`[ext] FewFeed extension active.` (flag worked) or
`[ext] --load-extension blocked; running post-launch loader...` (fallback ran).

## 🟡 BUG-7 — FewFeed: first `load_config` returns `None`

**File:** `fewfeedbotv6/fewfeed_bot_template.py:272`

The first `load_config` has no `return` → returns `None`; shadowed by the correct one at line 2932. The
module-level `config = load_config()` runs while only the buggy def exists, so the initial global `config`
is `None` until `main_menu()` reassigns it. Any code reading module-level `config` before `main_menu`
runs would see `None`.

---

## 🟡 BUG-8 — Launcher footguns

**File:** `start-bots.ps1`

- `Resolve-ReturnDesktopIndex` regex `comments?replybot` matches **both** `CommentsReplyBot` and
  `ReplyBot`; a bare `ReplyBot` return target wrongly resolves to desktop 2 instead of 4.
- A fallback path calls `Ensure-DesktopSwitch`, **a function that does not exist** → would throw if the
  module-based desktop return fails.
- Keep-alive `Wait-Process` only waits on FewFeed + ReplyBot PIDs; with only AutoJoin/Comments enabled
  the launcher wouldn't block on them.
- `ReplyBot.ManualAccounts.AccountsForOption2="6"` is ignored while `RotationEnabled=true` (rotation
  wins) — a common point of confusion about "which accounts run today."

---

## 🟡 BUG-9 — dashboard / tracker sharp edges

- `daily_stats` increments are **read-then-write, not atomic** — safe only within one process; multiple
  bot processes hitting the same row can lose increments.
- The 300s "offline" threshold is **hardcoded in 3 places** (`dashboard.py:91,164,199`).
- `reset_today` deletes events `created_at >= today T00:00:00Z` (**UTC** midnight) — can drop events that
  are "today" in the operator's local timezone.
- The broker's parent-watchdog kills Chrome by broad `CommandLine` match (any `--remote-debugging-port`,
  `new.py`, `fewfeed`, …) — can kill unrelated Chrome instances on the machine.

---

## ✅ Removed — "Failed Accounts" / "Attention Required" dashboard display

The **Failed Accounts** card and the **Attention Required** red alert panel have been removed from
`templates/dashboard.html`. The underlying data (`logged_out` status in the `accounts` table,
`login_failures` in `daily_stats`) is still recorded; it just is not prominently surfaced in the UI.
Per-account and per-bot detail pages still show login history.

---

## ✅ Fixed — `_parse_ts` NameError in `dashboard.py` broke `/api/overview`

`dashboard.py` called `_fmt_ts(_parse_ts(m.get("last_seen")))` in both `api_overview()` (line 130)
and `api_machines()` (line 330), but `_parse_ts` is only defined in `stats_tracker.py` — not imported
into `dashboard.py`. This would raise `NameError` the first time a machine heartbeat appeared, making
the `/api/overview` endpoint return `{"ok": false, "error": "name '_parse_ts' is not defined"}`.

**Fix:** removed the `_parse_ts()` wrapper — `_fmt_ts()` already handles ISO strings with a `T` in them
directly (`if "T" in ts: return ts`), so `_fmt_ts(m.get("last_seen"))` is correct and sufficient.

---

## ✅ Fixed — bot_commands table prerequisite (remote control not working)

**Root cause:** stop/restart buttons in the dashboard appeared to succeed ("queued") but nothing
happened because the `bot_commands` (and `machines`) tables did not yet exist in Supabase. The
`_supa_post` helper swallows non-200 responses silently, so the table-not-found 404 was invisible.

**Fix:** `setup_supabase.sql` now includes `bot_commands` (with `machine_id` column) and `machines`.
Run the full file once in the Supabase SQL Editor — all statements use `IF NOT EXISTS` so existing
data is safe. Once the tables exist, the full flow works:
`Dashboard → bot_commands → broker polls → executes on PC → marks done → dashboard shows result`.

## 🔴 Security — committed secrets

Across the repo (and ignored only partially by `.gitignore`): live **Telegram bot tokens** in each
`config.json`, the **Supabase anon key** in `supabase_config.json` (with permissive RLS → full
read/write/delete), Google **service-account JSONs**, hard-coded **FewFeed tool credentials** in source,
and real **cookie/credential** files. `DASHBOARD_PASSWORD` only protects the web UI, not Supabase. Rotate
these and move them out of version control.
